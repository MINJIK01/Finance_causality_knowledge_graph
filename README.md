# Finance causality knowledge graph
This project aims to construct a Finance Causality Knowledge Graph by analyzing global events. Leveraging the GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) dataset, this system detects causal relationships between various events and structures them into knowledge graph triples (Subject, Predicate, Object). The goal is to provide a structured representation of how global events influence financial dynamics through causal links.
